# anemia-prediction-using-conjuctiva-dataset-a-deep-learning-approach
This project presents a deep learning approach for predicting anemia by analyzing images of the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that covers the front of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict anemia levels based on visual cues from the conjunctiva.

Introduction
Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to predict anemia by analyzing images of the conjunctiva, which is known to show color changes associated with anemia.

Model Architecture
Deep Learning Model:
The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract features from conjunctiva images.
Additional fully connected layers are used for classification, predicting whether the subject is anemic or not.
Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

Ensure your conjunctiva images are organized and labeled correctly.
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data.

Dataset
The project uses a conjunctiva dataset specifically designed for anemia prediction.
